# The Purpose of Life

**"الَّذِي خَلَقَ الْمَوْتَ وَالْحَيَاةَ لِيَبْلُوَكُمْ أَيُّكُمْ أَحْسَنُ عَمَلًا ۚ وَهُوَ الْعَزِيزُ الْغَفُورُ"**  
**"He who created death and life to test you [as to] which of you is best in deed - and He is the Exalted in Might, the Forgiving."**  
**(Surah Al-Mulk, 67:2)**

As a child, prayer was more of a routine—a duty I fulfilled because I was told that Muslims must pray and fast once they reach puberty. Although I didn’t fully understand its deeper purpose, Alhamdulillah, I was guided to never neglect my prayers. Somehow, I was always protected, and in fact, I’ve felt that protection throughout my life, thanks to Allah, who loved us even before we knew to love Him. My life, however, was still centered around simple pleasures: cartoons, video games, baking cakes, studying, and playing with brothers and friends. Religion, at that time, was just another item on my to-do list, not something that truly resonated with my heart.

I wasn’t a bad kid, but I had my flaws. My actions weren’t guided by faith; they were simply the impulses of a teenager who didn’t know any better. I had a good heart, but I was also deeply ignorant—I didn’t truly know Allah, had never read the full Quran, and many of Islam’s teachings were foreign to me. Instead of being shaped by faith, we were influenced by media and movies, which molded our desires, behavior, understanding of life, and the way we lived it. We were wandering in a darkness of ignorance, unaware of how lost we truly were.

When I left home to study in another city, life’s challenges began to hit me hard. Suddenly, the familiar comforts of home were gone, and I was thrust into a world that seemed far more complex and unforgiving than I had imagined. At first, I didn’t understand what was happening. These struggles felt like bad luck or random obstacles thrown in my path. I remember sitting in my small dorm room, feeling the weight of loneliness and uncertainty, burdened by a sense of weariness that made me feel oddly old in my teenage years—much older than I feel now in my 30s. I couldn’t see the purpose behind the difficulties I was facing. I didn’t realize that these were more than just hardships; they were tests, just as described in the verse from Surah Al-Mulk.

It took many trials—tests I didn’t even recognize at the time—to uncover a profound truth: these challenges revealed how helpless, weak, and lost I was without Allah. I remember one particularly difficult time when I felt completely overwhelmed, sitting alone and questioning why everything seemed to be going wrong. It was in those moments of despair that I started to turn to Allah, not just out of habit, but out of a genuine need for His guidance and support. Through these challenges, I came to know Allah more deeply, learned to rely on Him fully, surrender to His will, and develop a genuine love for Him. These trials were Allah’s way of opening my eyes to how much I needed Him and how ignorant I had been.

Looking back, I no longer see those struggles as misfortunes, but as blessings in disguise. They were the catalysts for my spiritual awakening, teaching me that life’s trials are not meant to break us, but to shape us into better versions of ourselves. These challenges serve as powerful reminders of our need for Allah’s guidance, His mercy, and the importance of maintaining good expectations of Allah while trusting in the destiny He has written for us.

If only I had understood this earlier—if only I had truly known Allah—I might have navigated life’s path with greater clarity. Yet, it’s through these very experiences that I’ve learned the profound importance of relying on Allah and allowing these trials to shape me into the person I am today.
